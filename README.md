## Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation  
### **Description**  
A Python-based project leveraging deep learning to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. This application is designed to help users monitor their dietary intake, enabling informed food choices for healthier living. It utilizes the Food-101 dataset, pre-trained CNN models, and nutritional databases to provide accurate results for diverse food categories.

### **Features**  
- **Food Recognition with Deep Learning**  
  Identifies food items from a wide range of 101 categories using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  

- **Calorie Estimation**  
  Estimates the calorie content of food items by linking recognized foods to their nutritional information and portion sizes.
